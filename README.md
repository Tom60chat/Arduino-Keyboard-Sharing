# ArduinoKeyboard

Allow to open a port to an Arduino, to send keyboard input via serial.

I unfortly lost the Arduino script to send back to another device using a serial USB port connect to the arduino.

Btw, can be usefull if it append you need a keyboard but all you have it's a laptop and an arduino leonardi with a serial USB.
